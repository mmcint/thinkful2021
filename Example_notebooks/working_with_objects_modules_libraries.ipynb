    "## Abstraction and inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "To figure this out, think about abstraction for a moment. Consider the statement `1 + 2` and the statement `1 + 'pizza'`. You expect the first statement to work because both operands are numbers. And you (rightly) expect the second statement to fail because you can't add a number and a string. The operands in the second example aren't the same type of thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean to say that a number and a string aren't \"the same type\"? Similarly, what does \"integers are a type of number\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are both abstractions. Each integer has a whole bunch of attributes that it shares with other integers—attributes that it doesn't necessarily share with a string. For example, numbers can be even or odd, or composite or prime, but those concepts don't even make sense when talking about strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, different types of numbers share some attributes but not others. All integers are divisible by one, but other types of real numbers (like floats) don't have that attribute. *Number* is an abstract *class* that both integers and floats belong to, even though numbers and floats are different from each another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these cases, you can intellectually abstract away from specific instances of something (like `1` and `10` and `42`) to create a class (in this case, integers) where you list out all the attributes that the instances share with one another. Whenever you choose a specific instance of the class, you know that the instance inherits all of the properties of the class that it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this talk about abstraction is a bit heady, so take a look at the way that Python creates different types of numbers, using classes as a concrete example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers and floats are both a type of number. Python has a [numbers class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Number) that ints and floats belong to. They inherit the attributes of that class. Rational numbers are another type of number. Integers are rational numbers, but floats aren't, so integers inherit the attributes of the [rational class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Rational), but floats don't. You can read more detail about this and related numeric classes [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html), but the takeaway is that Python classes provide a way to define a type of object and allow all objects of a certain type to inherit the attributes of their class. All the unexpected attributes that you saw on the object `1` above are inherited from the classes that it belongs to.\n",

So next, you'll look at an example of setting up a custom object.\n",

    "Now, break down this example piece by piece. In the first line, the `class` keyword is used to start the definition of a new class. This works just like the `def` keyword that you can use to define new functions. After that comes the name of the new class (`Quark`). It's customary to use [CapWords capitalization](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#class-names) with custom classes. Next, follow the class name with parentheses `()` containing the class that you want to *subclass* from. If you don't have a more specific class that you'd like to subclass, the built-in `object` object has the most basic default attributes that you want to inherit.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"But wait,\" you might be thinking, \"what about the first `self` argument?\" Good question. In an object, the `self` variable is used to refer to the object itself. Every method expects `self` as the first argument. And whenever you call a method, `self` is passed in behind the scenes without you having to explicitly include it in your method call. When you're reading code that includes `self`, you can mentally replace that with \"the particular object that I'm dealing with\". For example, in plain English, `self.color = color` would read as follows:\n",
