Python functions, however, are a defined set of instructions that you can call and execute. You _can_ write that set of instructions to behave like a math function and map arguments onto a return value, but that isn't necessary. In fact, Python functions don't even need to have input or output values at all. The `print()` function is an example: it displays a message to you but doesn't return any value at all.\n",
